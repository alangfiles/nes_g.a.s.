   OVERTHROW OF ZARQAK   
                         
You did it! You  pumped  
                         
your heart out and helped
                         
free alien races unknown.
                         
                         
Or maybe you damned them 
                         
to permanent reliance on 
                         
space fossil fuels.      
                         
                         
It may be that you are a 
                         
hero! But was ZARQAK all 
                         
evil? Was he the hero    
                         
and you a minor villan?!?
                         
Are you just a pawn in a 
                         
game of Alien Life Forms.

                         
  HERO?!? VILLAIN ?!?!   
                         
Ethanol? Diesel? Leaded? 
                         
It all goes into the     
                         
ENGINE we call life...   
                         
                         
                         
You only know one thing  
                         
to be true, deeply true. 
                         
                         
    You pump gas.
