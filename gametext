.........................
It is the year 20XX and  
                         
a universal conflict     
                         
has been raging across   
                         
all the known galaxies.  
                         
                         
The evil alien ZARQAK has
                         
broken with the galactic 
                         
ALLIANCE, overthrowing a 
                         
thousand years of peace. 
                         
                         
ZARQAK has unlocked the  
                         
technology needed to put 
                         
space travel at risk. He 
                         
now holds the galactic   
                         
civilization hostage with
                         
the threat of using this 
                         
DEADLY ATTACK.           
                         
                         
Civilizations    are     
                         
scattered, lives ruined. 
                         
All run as far from this 
                         
war as they can...       
                         
                         
But a few WARRIORS stand 
                         
up to ZARQAK, and have   
                         
bravery to challenge him.
                         
                         
The search is on for the 
                         
BARTHOID crystals, rare  
                         
supernovae fragments that
                         
are said to have enormous
                         
power. Possibly enough   
                         
power to stop ZARQAK     
                         
before his plans come to 
                         
their evil conclusion... 
                         
                         
This is a time for heros.
                         
                         
                         
But none of that is for  
                         
you. You are a human of  
                         
earth, a small planet on 
                         
the outer edge of a small
                         
galaxy. You know nothing 
                         
of space wars and heros. 
                         
You only know one skill. 
                         
                         
      Pumping gas.
